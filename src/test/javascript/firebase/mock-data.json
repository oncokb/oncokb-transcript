      "background": "BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (PMID: 15520807), which under physiologic conditions regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular functions, including proliferation (PMID: 24202393). Genetic alterations in BRAF are found in a large percentage of melanomas, thyroid cancers and histiocytic neoplasms as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308). The product of these alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances, is directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807). Inhibitors of mutant BRAF, including vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are FDA-approved for the treatment of late-stage or unresectable melanoma. ",

In a randomized Phase III trial comparing vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) with dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks) for treatment-naive, metastatic, BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, vemurafenib was associated with better overall survival (median survival 13.6 months vs. 9.7 months; hazard ratio 0.70, p=.0008) and longer median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 1.6 months) (PMID: 24508103). Final overall survival data from the BRIM-3 study showed that the survival advantage of vemurafenib over dacarbazine persisted through the 4-year landmark, with survival rates for vemurafenib and dacarbazine at the 4-year landmark being 17.0% and 15.6%, respectively (PMID: 28961848). However, a trial evaluating clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma treated with either combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib compared to those treated with vemurafenib monotherapy demonstrated improved survival outcomes in the combination-therapy group compared to the vemurafenib group (PMID: 25399551).",

Vemurafenib is listed as a 2A therapeutic in the NCCN guidelines for Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) based on data from two Phase II trials. In one study of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant HCL (n=24), the overall response rate was 100%, with 42% of patients (10 of 24) having complete responses, with a response duration of 11.7 months and one year progression free and overall survival rates of 73% and 91%, repectively (PMID: 26352686). In another study of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant HCL (n=26), the overall response rate was 96%, with 35% of patients (9 of 26) having complete responses (PMID: 26352686).",

Patients with various glioma subtypes harboring BRAF V600E mutations have shown responses to RAF and MEK inhibition. Three out of five patients with anaplastic astrocytoma had a response (one partial response, two stable disease) to vemurafenib monotherapy (PMID: 30351999). One patient with high-grade glioma (NOS) had stable disease in response to vemurafenib monotherapy (PMID:30351999). Four out of eight patients with glioma (NOS) had a response (one partial response, three stable disease, two progressive disease, two not evaluable) to vemurafenib monotherapy (PMID: 26287849). One patient with anaplastic oligoastrocytoma had stable disease in response to vemurafenib monotherapy (PMID: 30462564). Four of seven patients with glioblastoma multiforme had a response (one complete response, three stable disease, one progressive disease, two not evaluable) to vemurafenib monotherapy (PMID: 30351999, 24725538). Four patients with glioblastoma (including epithelioid glioblastoma) had a response (one “near-complete” response, three stable disease) to either dabrafenib monotherapy (n=2) or vemurafenib monotherapy (n=2) (PMID: 29621181, 29039591, 33117675, 34232949).",

Patients with various glioma subtypes harboring BRAF V600E mutations have shown responses to RAF and MEK inhibition. Six patients with ganglioglioma had a partial response to either vemurafenib monotherapy (n=2), vemurafenib + cobimetinib (n=1), or dabrafenib monotherapy (n=​​3)(PMID: 25524464, 31985841, 26579623, 31502039). Twelve out of thirteen patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma had a response (one complete response, one “near-complete” response, six partial response, four stable disease) to either dabrafenib + trametinib (n=2) or vemurafenib monotherapy (n=11) (PMID: 28984141, 26287849, 30351999).

Of the 131 adult patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib, the overall response rate was 41% (54/131; 95% CI = 33-50) and of the 36 pediatric patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib (low-grade glioma, n=34; high-grade glioma, n=2), the overall response rate was 25% (95% CI = 12-24) (PMID: 32818466, 34838156, 32758030)(Abstract: Bouffet et al.

In the Phase II ROAR basket trial of dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated rare cancers (biliary tract cancer, n=43), the overall response rate was 53%, the median progression-free survival was nine months (95% CI = 5.5, 9.4) and the median overall survival was 13.5 months (95% CI = 10.4, 17.6) (PMID: 37059834). Of the 43 patients with biliary tract cancer, 53% of patients (23/43) had a partial response and 37% (16/43) had stable disease (PMID: 37059834). Additionally, in subprotocol H of the NCI-MATCH basket trial of dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant solid tumors (n=4 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), the overall response rate was 100%, with 4/4 patients achieving a partial response (PMID: 32758030).",

FDA approval was based on data from 131 adult patients with solid tumors treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in the BRF117019 and NCI-MATCH trials and 36 pediatric patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in the CTMT212X2101 study. Of the 131 adult patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib, the overall response rate was 41% (54/131; 95% CI = 33-50) and of the 36 pediatric patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib (low-grade glioma, n=34; high-grade glioma, n=2), the overall response rate was 25% (95% CI = 12-24) (PMID: 32818466, 34838156, 32758030)(Abstract: Bouffet et al.

This mutation is recurrent in melanoma (PMID: 22798288, 26643848). Biological characterization of BRAF K601E mutations demonstrated that they activate the downstream MAPK pathway independently of RAS and render BRAF active as a dimer with CRAF and itself (PMID: 22798288, 20179705, 26343582). Preclinical studies with patient-derived xenograft models of colorectal cancer expressing BRAF K601E demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with PLX8394 with or without cetuximab as measured by reduced tumor growth, and resistance to treatment with cetuximab and vemurafenib as measured by no reduction in tumor growth upon treatment (PMID: 30559419, 31515458). A patient with metastatic BRAF K601E-mutated melanoma achieved a complete response to the MEK inhibitor trametinib (PMID: 28344857). In a case report, a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring BRAF K601E was treated with a combination therapy of dabrafenib plus trametinib and demonstrated partial response with a progression-free survival of nine months (PMID: 34590045). In another case report, a patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma harboring BRAF K601E was treated with a combination therapy of sorafenib plus denosumab and demonstrated a complete response (PMID: 35630083). In a Phase II trial, a patient with melanoma harboring BRAF K601E was treated with trametinib and demonstrated partial response with a progression-free survival of 32 weeks (PMID: 23248257). In another Phase II trial, six patients with advanced solid tumors harboring BRAF K601E were treated with vemurafenib and did not clinically respond to treatment (PMID: 29320312). In a Phase I trial, two patients with melanoma harboring BRAF K601E were treated with dabrafenib and did not clinically respond to treatment (PMID: 22608338).",

An additional case study of a six-year-old child with BRAF V600E-mutant mixed systemic Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease and Langerhans cell histiocytosis reported sustained clinical and radiographic responses after treatment with dabrafenib prior to disease relapse at thirteen months (PMID: 31213430).",

            "description": "The class I (PMID: 28783719) activating exon 15 BRAF V600K missense mutation is located in the kinase domain of the BRAF protein. BRAF V600 alterations (predominantly V600E) are recurrent in lung (PMID: 25079552, 23833300) and thyroid (PMID: 25417114) cancers, among others. In metastatic melanoma, frequency of V600K mutation is second only to V600E, the most common BRAF alteration (PMID: 26091043). Analysis of clinicopathologic features and outcome in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring activating BRAF mutations revealed that, compared to V600E, V600K mutation was significantly associated with male sex, older age (median age, head/neck primary tumor location, shorter interval to stage IV disease, and shorter overall survival from the time of diagnosis of stage IV disease (PMID: 23922205, 22535154). Comprehensive biological characterization of BRAF V600K mutation (PMID: 15035987, 26343582) has demonstrated that this mutation activates the downstream MAPK pathway independently of RAS (PMID: 19251651, 26343582), renders BRAF constitutively activated in monomeric form (PMID: 20179705) and retains sensitivity to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 26343582, 28783719, 20179705). Preliminary studies suggest that BRAF V600K mutant tumors may not respond to combined BRAF and MEK inhibition as well as BRAF V600E tumors due to a decreased reliance on the MAPK pathway, though further studies are needed to validate this finding (PMID: 30630828).",

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

In an open-label, randomized Phase III trial, patients with BRAF V600E/K-mutated unresectable, metastatic melanoma received oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) or an intravenous regimen of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) every three weeks. Trametinib demonstrated improved progression-free survival (HR for disease progression or death = 0.45) and six-month overall survival (81% vs. 67%; death HR = 0.54; p=0.01) (PMID: 22663011). However, like other MEK inhibitors, the benefit of trametinib is limited by adverse reactions, most notably grade three or four rash and diarrhea (PMID: 22663011). Trametinib is not typically used as monotherapy for patients with BRAF V600K melanoma given its lower response rate compared to BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Patients previously treated with a RAF inhibitor appear to be less likely than untreated patients to respond to trametinib treatment (PMID: 22663011), and FDA guidelines state that trametinib as a monotherapy is not indicated for these patients. Dabrafenib and trametinib are FDA-approved as a combination therapy, which has superior clinical outcomes compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy (PMID: 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings had improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468).",

In vitro studies of cell lines engineered to express BRAF L597R or L597S mutations demonstrated sensitivity to MEK inhibition as measured by decreased activation of downstream effector proteins upon treatment with trametinib (PMID: 22798288, 29903896).",

In a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with or without BRAF mutation, there were two (28%) partial responses of seven evaluable BRAF-mutant patients treated with PLX8394 and cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Abstract: Janku et al. Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations.

In vitro studies of cell lines engineered to express BRAF K601E demonstrated sensitivity to MEK inhibition as measured by decreased activation of downstream effector proteins upon treatment with trametinib (PMID: 22798288, 29903896).",

In a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with or without BRAF mutation, there were two (28%) partial responses of seven evaluable BRAF-mutant patients treated with PLX8394 and cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor (Abstract: Janku et al. Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. In a phase I/IIa trial of PLX8394 for patients with BRAF-altered, advanced solid or CNS tumors (n=110; n=61, patients with class 1 mutations; n=19, patients with class 2 mutations [excluding fusions]; n=17, patients with BRAF fusions), partial response was achieved in 39% (n=9/23) of patients with MAPKi-naive, V600-mutant tumors, with a median duration of response (DoR) of 32 months, and in 18% (n=3/17) of patients with MAPKi treated, V600-mutant tumors (n=6, patients with V600-mutant glioma; n=3, patients with V600-mutant ovarian cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant small bowel cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant papillary thyroid cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer) (Abstract: Fuente et al.

In vitro studies have suggested that this mutation is resistant to dabrafenib, as measured by increased MAPK pathway activation upon drug treatment, but sensitive to trametinib, as measured by decreased MAPK pathway activation upon drug treatment (PMID: 28947956). As BRAF D594E is a kinase-dead mutation, it is suggested to be insensitive to treatment with vemurafenib (PMID: 28026870).",

Biological characterization of the BRAF D594N mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 28783719, 26498038). Thus, when BRAF D594N is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 28783719). In a case report, a patient with EGFR-positive, MET-amplified non-small cell lung cancer acquired BRAF D594N as a secondary resistance mutation in response to combination treatment with osimertinib plus crizotinib (PMID: 36136993).

Biological characterization of the BRAF D287H mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 26343582, 28783719). In melanoma, the D287H variant, similar to other class III BRAF mutants, would be expected to co-occur with activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, this mutation would most likely be associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719).

Similar to other kinase-inactivating BRAF mutations, the Y472C mutant promotes downstream oncogenic signaling (via MEK/ERK pathway) by transactivating CRAF, and therefore is considered to be likely oncogenic in the clinical setting (PMID: 22649091).

This mutation has been reported in lung cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma (PMID: 26498038). Biological characterization of the BRAF N581S mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 15035987, 28783719). Thus, in melanoma, the N581S variant, similar to other class III BRAF mutants, would be expected to co-occur with activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, this mutation would most likely be associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719).  Preclinical studies with patient-derived lung adenocarcinoma cells expressing BRAF N581S demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with a combination therapy of PF-477736 plus PF3644022 as measured by increased apoptosis (PMID: 26140595). In a Phase II trial, two patients with lung adenocarcinoma and gynecologic cancer harboring BRAF N581S were treated with trametinib and demonstrated progressive disease and stable disease, respectively (PMID: 31924734). In a case report, a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring BRAF N581S was treated with a combination therapy of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI and demonstrated partial response with a progression-free survival of sixteen months (PMID: 31515458). In another Phase II trial, two patients with advanced solid tumors harboring the mutation were treated with vemurafenib and did not clinically respond to treatment (PMID: 29320312).",

This mutation has been reported in histiocytic sarcoma, colorectal cancer and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (PMID: 26582644, 15150094, 26150740). Biological characterization of the BRAF F595L mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 28783719, 15035987, 15150094). Thus, when BRAF F595L is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719, 20141835). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 28783719, 26582644). A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring BRAF F595L was treated with a combination therapy of FOLFOX plus panitumumab and experienced partial response with a progression-free survival of 10.2 months (PMID: 31515458).",

However, a second study in human cell lines demonstrated that this mutation has kinase activity comparable to wildtype BRAF (PMID: 26996308).

Preclinical studies with NIH3T3 cells expressing BRAF L485_P490del demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with LY3009120, as measured by inhibition of MEK and ERK phosphorylation, and resistance to treatment with vemurafenib, as measured by sustained MEK and ERK signaling and proliferation (PMID: 26732095).

In a study of patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer, a patient with a CUL1-BRAF fusion who progressed on carboplatin and paclitaxel had a sustained complete response to treatment with paclitaxel and a MEK1/2 inhibitor (selumetinib) (PMID: 26324360).  Additionally, in vitro studies have demonstrated that BRAF fusions are sensitive to MEK inhibition as measured decreased downstream MAPK pathway signaling in BRAF fusion-containing cells upon treatment with trametinib (PMID: 24345920).",

This fusion contains the BRAF kinase domain, but excludes the BRAF CR1 domain responsible for RAS binding and auto-inhibition (PMID: 18974108, 24345920). This fusion has been found in pilocytic astrocytoma (PMID: 18974108, 24345920). Expression of this fusion in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that it is activating as measured by constitutive kinase activity and increased anchorage independent growth in soft agar compared to wildtype BRAF (PMID: 18974108). KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein functions as a dimer and is therefore not sensitive to RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib in vitro (PMID: 23533272). Preclinical evidence suggests that these oncoproteins may be targeted by second-generation RAF inhibitors, which are reported to inhibit RAF dimers rather than induce their transactivation of RAF (as is the case with older inhibitors such as vemurafenib) (PMID: 23533272). In vitro studies have suggested that pediatric astrocytoma cell lines harboring the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion are resistant to treatment with first generation RAF inhibitors (PMID: 23533272, 26072686). In a Phase II clinical trial of selumetinib in 25 patients with WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma harboring either the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAF V600E mutation, nine patients (36% [95% CI:18-57%]) had a sustained partial response (PMID: 31151904).",

BRAF overexpression has been associated with increased proliferation in gliomas (PMID: 25618114). Amplification of BRAF V600E allele has been described as a mechanism of resistance to MEK/RAF inhibitors in melanoma via MAPK pathway hyperactivation (PMID: 22395615, 24055054, 21098728).",

Abstract# B176, AACR-NCI-EORTC 2017. http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/17/1_Supplement/B176). Both responses were in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. In a phase I/IIa trial of PLX8394 for patients with BRAF-altered, advanced solid or CNS tumors (n=110; n=61, patients with class 1 mutations; n=19, patients with class 2 mutations [excluding fusions]; n=17, patients with BRAF fusions), partial response was achieved in 39% (n=9/23) of patients with MAPKi-naive, V600-mutant tumors, with a median duration of response (DoR) of 32 months, and in 18% (n=3/17) of patients with MAPKi treated, V600-mutant tumors (n=6, patients with V600-mutant glioma; n=3, patients with V600-mutant ovarian cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant small bowel cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant papillary thyroid cancer; n=1, patients with V600-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer) (Abstract: Fuente et al.

Oncol. 2023, Vol 41, Suppl 16. https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2023.41.16_suppl.3006). \nPreclinical studies show that PLX8394 specifically inhibits BRAF-containing dimers and inhibits proliferation and pathway activation in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cell lines (PMID: 26466569, 28659148, 30559419, 28783719).",

This fusion protein is found in patients with sporadic microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancers (PMID: 30279230). Expression of this fusion protein in NIH3T3 cells demonstrated that it was activating as shown by increased colony formation and pathway activation compared to expression of BRAF alone (PMID: 30279230). Preclinical studies with patient-derived xenograft models expressing ARMC10-BRAF demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with MEK inhibitor trametinib and ERK inhibitor SCH772984 as measured by tumor regression and decreased phosphorylated ERK following treatment (PMID: 30254212).",

In an open-label phase II trial (NCT02649972) of cobimetinib in eighteen adult patients with histiocytoses (n = two patients with LCH) of any mutational status, the overall response rate was 89% (90% CI: 73–100), 100% of responses were ongoing at one year, and 94% of patients remained progression-free (PMID: 30867592). In a study of three patients with LCH who were treated with trametinib, two patients harbored BRAF N486_P490del mutations, of which one had no reactivation and the other had a partial response, and the third patient with a MAP2K1 K57_G61del mutation had a complete response with no active disease after 22 months (PMID: 32991018).",

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only two weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

This mutation has been found in melanoma (PMID: 22113612). In concordance with its ability to constitutively dimerize, in vitro studies of this mutation suggest that it is resistant to vemurafenib, as measured by persistent MAPK pathway signaling and cell proliferation upon drug treatment (PMID: 22113612). In one study, six out of nineteen patients with melanomas that were resistant to vemurafenib harbored the p61BRAF(V600E) mutation (PMID: 22113612).

ROS1 rearrangements where the kinase domain is retained (PMID: 22327623) are implicated in a range of human epithelial cancers including cholangiocarcinoma (PMID: 21253578), ovarian carcinoma (PMID: 22163003), gastric carcinoma (PMID: 23400546), angiosarcoma (PMID: 23637631) and most commonly non-small cell lung cancer (PMID: 22215748).

Experiments also supported the notion that D2033N confers resistance to ceritinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib.

Expression of this mutant in TP53-null cells resulted in decreased transactivation of p53 target genes, as a measured by a luciferase reporter assay (PMID: 25584008). Additionally, the TP53 R248L mutation failed to suppress colony growth in a colony reduction assay compared to wildtype TP53 (PMID: 25584008). Ovarian cancer patient samples and mouse models expressing this mutation were sensitive to an amyloid aggregate TP53 inhibitor as evidenced by apoptosis assays. Some TP53 mutations have been shown to form amyloid aggregates that leads to inactivation of the TP53 protein. Responsiveness of this variant to amyloid aggregate inhibitors suggest that this is a loss-of-function mutation (PMID: 26748848).",

Expression of this mutation in TP53-null cells did not alter TP53 transactivation in luciferase assays or colony growth as compared to expression of wildtype TP53 (PMID: 25584008). However, in a separate study, cells expressing TP53 G334R demonstrated impaired suppression ability in a colony reduction assay compared to wildtype cells. Additionally, immortalized G334R-mutant lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated impaired activation of a subset of TP53 target genes (including PCLO, PLTP, PLXNB3 and LCN15) following treatment with Nutlin-3A.  Further analysis showed TP53 G334R had reduced thermal stability compared to wild type cells (PMID: 32675277).",

Additionally, deletion of TP53 in the neurons of mice, while not sufficient to cause tumor development, allows the accumulation of other oncogenic mutations leading to tumorigenesis (PMID: 19477430). Further, loss of TP53 protein during 17p deletion events in leukemia/lymphoma, enhances cancer development through cooperation of linked tumor suppressive genes such as EIF5A and ALOX15B (PMID: 26982726).",

Experimental studies have revealed that truncating mutations promote cancer cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, since ectopic expression of these mutations in melanoma cells increased cell motility and tumor formation in vivo. This was due in part to aberrant localization of truncated proteins to the mitochondria, regulating genes involved in cell survival, including CypD (PMID: 27759562).",

      "background": "ATM is a member of the protein superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related serine/threonine kinases (PIKKs). ATM functions as a tumor suppressor that initiates DNA damage checkpoint signaling after accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or after accumulation of other forms of cellular stress (PMID: 23219553). Activated ATM can phosphorylate hundreds of substrates in order to initiate and amplify the DNA damage response (PMID: 17525332) resulting in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Germline, homozygous/compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ATM have been identified in the autosomal recessive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a disorder that presents with a variety of neurologic conditions, lung and skin disorders, and immunodeficiency (PMID: 21792198). Patients with A-T are also predisposed to a wide variety of cancers, particularly childhood lymphomas and leukemia as well as breast cancer (PMID: 21792198), whereas heterozygous carriers are at increased risk for adult-onset breast (PMID: 27112364, 31171119, 33471974), pancreatic (PMID: 22585167, 34529012), prostate (PMID: 33436325), gastroesophageal junction (PMID: 35078243), and other cancers. Somatic mutations in ATM have been identified in lymphoid malignancies and a selection of solid tumors (PMID: 12400598, 27413114). ATM-mutant cancers are increasingly sensitive to DNA damaging agents due to deficits in DNA repair pathways, and ATM loss may result in better response to checkpoint inhibition in some cancers (PMID: 27413114, 29489427).\n",

      "background": "BAP1 (BRCA-associated Protein-1) is a nuclear ubiquitin hydrolase that has been implicated in several cellular processes including cell proliferation, DNA repair, chromatin regulation of gene expression, and stem cell pluripotency (PMID: 19815555, 20805357, 18757409). By deubiquitinating host cell factor-1 (HCF-1), a chromatin-associated protein that helps regulate transcription, BAP1 regulates cell proliferation (PMID: 19815555). BAP1 has been shown to regulate gene expression by forming a ternary complex with HCF-1 and the YY1 transcription factor (PMID: 20805357) and to enhance cell death by increasing progression through the G1-S checkpoint (PMID: 18757409). BAP1 loss alters class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) expression, which may result in altered therapeutic response to HDAC inhibitors in BAP1-depleted cancer cells (PMID: 25970771). Germline mutations of the BAP1 tumor suppressor gene predispose to several tumors, most commonly including uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, which suggests that BAP1 is a tumor suppressor (PMID: 21874000, 23277170, 23849051, 32690542). Somatic BAP1 mutations are also common in these tumor types, among others (PMID: 23867514, 21642991, 23277170).",

Heterozygous truncating variants in BAP1 are known to be pathogenic. This variant is absent from large population databases (1000 Genomes, ESP, and Broad ExAc). It has been reported in the literature to segregate with disease in four members of a family with melanoma or dysplastic nevi (PMID: 26774355). Immunohistochemistry of the tumors in this family showed loss of BAP1 protein expression.",

A clinical study described a patient with chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) positive for the disease-specific FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion that developed resistance to imatinib due to the previously described secondary resistance mutation T674I (PMID: 19212337). Subsequently, the patient progressed on sorafenib and in the post-progression specimen, the D842V mutation had replaced T674I. Experiments in cell lines transformed with the PDGFRA fusion confirmed that the T674I mutation confers resistance to imatinib but not sorafenib, whereas D842V mediated resistance to both inhibitors as measured by cellular growth and sustained pathway activation (PMID: 19212337).",

This mutation was found in a patient with BRAF V600E-mutant anaplastic ganglioglioma who progressed on treatment with dabrafenib (PMID: 29880583). Co-expression of this mutation in human cells with BRAF V600E in cis demonstrated that it is activating, promotes dimerization, and confers resistance to type I αC-OUT/DFG-IN BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib (PMID: 29880583). The BRAF L514V mutation was shown to be sensitive to inhibition with RAF dimer inhibitors, such as BGB3245 (PMID: 29880583).",

While this alteration has not been functionally characterized per se, many other BRAF fusions have been shown to be oncogenic suggesting that the PCBP2-BRAF fusion is likely oncogenic (PMID: 24345920, 21424530, 22745804, 21424530, 18974108, 26343582). In a study of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who progressed on osimertinib, one patient harbored the PCBP2-BRAF fusion (PMID: 30257958). Knockdown of BRAF in a cell line created from this patient led to a reduction of cell growth and resensitization to osimertinib (PMID: 30257958). While these cells were insensitive to the BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and LXH245, they were sensitive to the MEK inhibitor trametinib (PMID: 30257958).",

              "new": "BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (PMID: 15520807), which under physiologic conditions regulates the expression of genes involved in cellular functions, including proliferation (PMID: 24202393). Genetic alterations in BRAF are found in a large percentage of melanomas, thyroid cancers and histiocytic neoplasms as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to constitutive BRAF activation, as BRAF V600E can signal as a monomer independently of RAS or upstream activation (PMID: 20179705). Other BRAF mutations have been found that affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582, 12068308).

A clinicopathologic study of a cohort of 1119 Australian patients with known BRAF mutant status positive melanomas demonstrated that at 3.4% of patients, BRAF L597 mutations are one of the most commonly occuring non-BRAF V600E mutations and have distinct clinicopathologic features. This study found that L597 melanomas typically occur in older (median 66 yr) male (73.3% of L597 mutant cases) patients and were associated with chronically sun damaged skin (extremities or head and neck location - 73.3%, P = 0.001) (PMID: 26643848). Expression of this mutation in 293H cells demonstrated that it is likely activating, as measured by increased downstream MEK and ERK activation compared to vector control (PMID: 22798288). In vitro studies suggest that this mutation may be sensitive to vemurafenib and trametinib as measured by decreased MEK and ERK activation upon drug treatment similar to BRAF V600E (PMID: 22798288). A patient with melanoma harboring the BRAF L597S mutation demonstrated 33% tumor shrinkage when treated with trametinib as the first-line treatment with a partial response for 6.2 months (PMID: 24933606) and in another independent study, a patient with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma demonstrated partial radiographic response with 31% tumor shrinkage after 2 cycles treatment with allosteric MEK inhibitor (PMID: 22798288). A third study also contained a case report of a patient with melanoma harboring the BRAF L597S mutation who exhibited an objective radiographic response to dabrafenib + trametinib (PMID: 29903896)."

The AGK-BRAF fusion protein contains the BRAF kinase domain, but lacks the BRAF CR1 domain that is responsible for RAS-binding and auto-inhibition (PMID: 23890088, 24135138). This fusion is found in spitzoid melanoma, glioma, and post-Chernobyl patients with thyroid cancer (PMID: 23890088, PMID: 26314551). Expression of AGK-BRAF in mouse fibroblasts demonstrated that this fusion is activating and transforming as measured by increased growth and colony formation in soft agar compared to GFP control (PMID: 24135138). In vitro studies of AGK-BRAF in melanoma cell lines suggest that this fusions is sensitive to sorafenib but not vemurafenib as measured by cell viability upon drug treatment (PMID: 23890088). AGK-BRAF fusion was observed in 3 of 174 EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma with primary resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).  Functional studies with the induction of AGK-BRAF fusion in H1975 (L858R + T790M), PC9 (ex19del) and HCC827 (ex19del) cell lines conferred resistance to growth inhibition by EGFR TKI (PMID: 30831205)."

The FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551).

Oncol. 28. 2010. http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2010.28.15_suppl.3534). This is thought to be due to upregulation of EGFR signaling in the setting of BRAF inhibition in CRC (PMID: 22448344). Pilot and phase II clinical trial data suggest a response rate of ~10-20% for the RAF and EGFR inhibitor combinations of vemurafenib + panitumumab (PMID: 25589621) or dabrafenib + panitumumab (http://oncologypro.esmo.org/Meeting-Resources/ESMO-2016/Efficacy-and-circulating-tumor-DNA-ctDNA-analysis-of-the-BRAF-inhibitor-dabrafenib-D-MEK-inhibitor-trametinib-T-and-anti-EGFR-antibody-panitumumab-P-in-patients-pts-with-BRAF-V600E-mutated-BRAFm-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-mCRC). More recently, a 3-arm clinical trial in 142 patients with BRAFV600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with either dabrafenib + panitumumab, dabrafenib+trametinib + panitumumab or trametinib+panitumumab and confirmed response rates were 10%, 21%, and 0% with median progression-free survival at 3.5, 4.2 and 2.6 months respectively. Measurement of pERK in matched pre-and on-treatment biopsy samples, found that dabrafenib+trametinib + panitumumab was associated with the highest level of MAPK pathway inhibition (PMID: 29431699).",

This fusion contains the BRAF kinase domain, but excludes the BRAF CR1 domain responsible for RAS binding and auto-inhibition (PMID: 18974108, 24345920). This fusion has been found in pilocytic astrocytoma (PMID: 18974108, 24345920). Expression of this fusion in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that it is activating as measured by constitutive kinase activity and increased anchorage independent growth in soft agar compared to wildtype BRAF (PMID: 18974108). KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein functions as a dimer and is therefore not sensitive to RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib in vitro (PMID: 23533272). Preclinical evidence suggests that these oncoproteins may be targeted by second-generation RAF inhibitors, which are reported to inhibit RAF dimers rather than induce their transactivation of RAF (as is the case with older inhibitors such as vemurafenib) (PMID: 23533272). In vitro studies have suggested that pediatric astrocytoma cell lines harboring the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion are resistant to treatment with first generation RAF inhibitors (PMID: 23533272, 26072686). In a Phase II clinical trial of selumetinib in 25 patients with WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma harboring either the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or the BRAF V600E mutation, nine patients (36% [95% CI:18-57%]) had a sustained partial response (PMID: 31151904)."

The FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

The FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878)."

This study found that L597 melanomas typically occur in older (median 66 yr) male (73.3% of L597 mutant cases) patients and were associated with chronically sun damaged skin (extremities or head and neck location - 73.3%, P = 0.001) (PMID: 26643848).

Thus, when BRAF D594G is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719).

In a separate report, expression of the BRAF E501K in cell lines did not lead to an increase in RAS-ERK activity as measured by a luciferase reporter assay (PMID: 16474404)."

A clinicopathologic study of a cohort of 1119 Australian patients with known BRAF mutant status positive melanomas demonstrated that at 3.2% of patients, BRAF K601E mutations are some of the most commonly occurring BRAF non-V600E mutations. These BRAF mutations occurred predominantly in males, median age 58 years. These tumors were generally found to occur on the trunk (64%), and revealed no association with chronically sun-damaged (CSD) skin (PMID: 26643848). Biological characterization of BRAF K601E mutations demonstrated that they activate the downstream MAPK pathway independently of RAS (PMID: 22798288, 26343582), render BRAF active as a dimer with CRAF and itself (PMID: 20179705, 26343582) and while sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib (PMID: 28783719, 22798288, 18794803), are insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 22798288, 28783719, 20179705)."

The FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

The FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002). However, median progression-free survival improved by only 2 weeks (9.3 months vs 8.8 months; HR = 0.75) compared with dabrafenib monotherapy (PMID: 23020132). Combination therapy is associated with less cutaneous toxicity than monotherapy, but systemic toxicity may be increased (PMID: 25287827, 25399551). Follow-up trials have demonstrated that all clinical measures inclusive of overall and median progression-free survival as well as objective response rates, median duration of response and number of patients with complete response favored patients treated with combination dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, compared to either dabrafenib or vemurafenib monotherapy, including patients who previously progressed on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (PMID: 25287827, 25399551, 25265492). Additionally, patients with melanoma treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings have improved survival over patients given standard of care (PMID: 29361468, 28991513, 28891408). Promising clinical data has also suggested that addition of an immunotherapy agent to combination RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment may improve rate of overall response and duration of response in melanoma patients (PMID: 31171876, 31171879, 31171878).",

In vitro studies have demonstrated that this mutation, similar to other class 1 BRAF V600 mutations, activates the downstream MAPK pathway independent of RAS, as measured by increased levels of phosphorylated MEK and decreased RAS-GTP in V600E mutant cells compared to wildtype (PMID: 26343582, 28783719). The BRAF V600M mutation renders BRAF constitutively activated in monomeric form and is sensitive to inhibition by vemurafenib (PMID: 28783719, 25382067, 26343582). However, It is unknown whether the BRAF V600M mutation actually arises in cancer as noted by several studies (PMID: 22536370, 23579220, 25382067) or previous sequencing studies miscalled a V600R dinucleotide change (chromosome 7: position 140453136 AC > CT) as a single nucleotide change (chromosome 7: position 140453137 C >T).",

In a Phase II, single-arm basket trial of dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant solid tumors, of 43 patients with biliary tract cancer, the overall response rate was 51% (22/43, 95% CI 36–67), the median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI 5-10), and the median overall survival was 14 months (95% CI 10-33). Of the 43 patients with biliary tract cancer, 51% of patients (22/43) had a partial response and 40% (17/43) had stable disease (PMID: 32818466). Additionally, in subprotocol H of the NCI-MATCH basket trial of dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant solid tumors (N=4 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), the overall response rate was 100%, with 4/4 patients achieving a partial response (PMID: 32758030).",

FDA-approval was based on data from 131 adult patients with solid tumors treated with dabrafenib and trametinib in the BRF117019 and NCI-MATCH trials and 36 pediatric patients treated with dabrafinib and trametinib in the CTMT212X2101 study. Of the 131 adult patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib, the overall response rate was 41% (54/131; 95% CI = 33-50) and of the 36 pediatric patients treated with dabrafenib and trametinib (low grade glioma, n=34; high grade glioma, n=2), the overall response rate was 25% (95% CI = 12-24) (PMID: 32818466, 34838156, 32758030)(Abstract: Bouffet et al.

In a Phase II, single-arm basket trial of dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant solid tumors, of 43 patients with biliary tract cancer, the overall response rate was 51% (22/43, 95% CI 36–67), the median progression-free survival was 9 months (95% CI 5-10), and the median overall survival was 14 months (95% CI 10-33). Of the 43 patients with biliary tract cancer, 51% of patients (22/43) had a partial response and 40% (17/43) had stable disease (PMID: 32818466). Additionally, in subprotocol H of the NCI-MATCH basket trial of dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant solid tumors (N=4 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), the overall response rate was 100%, with 4/4 patients achieving a partial response (PMID: 32758030).",

Biological characterization of the BRAF D594N mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 28783719, 26498038). Thus, when BRAF D594N is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 28783719)."

Expression of this mutation in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that it is activating as measured by increased kinase activity, downstream ERK activation and increased colony formation compared to wildtype BRAF (PMID: 23833300). In a case report, a 63-year old woman with stage IV Non-small cell lung cancer harboring the V600_K601delinsE BRAF mutation had progressive disease upon treatment with vemurafenib (PMID: 26045855). In a second case report, a patient with BRAF V600_K601delinsE-mutant melanoma had a partial response to the combination of BRAF, MEK and CDK4/6 inhibition (PMID: 28800030).",

FDA approval of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was based on results from an open-label Phase III study of combination therapy versus dabrafenib monotherapy in 247 patients with metastatic melanoma who were naive to treatment with BRAF inhibitors. Combined dabrafenib and trametinib, administered in full monotherapy doses, improved the response rate in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma versus dabrafenib monotherapy (67% vs.51%; p<0.002).

Thus, when BRAF F595L is observed in melanoma, it typically co-occurs with an activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas when observed in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, it is associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719, 20141835). While this mutation is sensitive to MEK inhibition by targeted inhibitors such as trametinib, it is insensitive to RAF monomer inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PMID: 28783719, 26582644). A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring BRAF F595L was treated with a combination therapy of FOLFOX plus panitumumab and experienced partial response with a progression-free survival of 10.2 months (PMID: 31515458)."

Thus, like other class III BRAF mutants, in melanoma, the F595L variant would be expected to co-occur with activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas in non-small cell lung and colorectal cancers, this mutation would most likely be associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719).

Preclinical studies with melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600D demonstrate sensitivity to treatment with CCT196969, CCT241161, AZ628, TAK-632, PLX7904, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, ASTX029 and cobimetinib plus HM95573 as measured by inhibition of MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cellular proliferation (PMID: 25500121, 17210691, 27523909, 33953400, 34330842). In a case report, a patient with pilocytic astrocytoma harboring BRAF V600D was treated with single-agent dabrafenib then subsequently treated with combination therapy of dabrafenib plus trametinib and demonstrated stable disease (PMID: 28784858). In a Phase II trial, a patient with non-small cell lung cancer harboring BRAF V600D was treated with vemurafenib and demonstrated partial response with a progression-free survival of 3.8 months (PMID: 31959346)."

This mutation has been reported in melanoma, lung cancer and colorectal cancer (PMID: 14678966, 26498038). Biological characterization of the BRAF G596R mutation has demonstrated that it is RAS dependent in its activation of the MAPK pathway, signals as a dimer with CRAF, and typically co-occurs with another driver mechanism that amplifies RAS signaling (PMID: 15035987, 28783719, 16364920). Thus, in melanoma, the G596R variant, similar to other class III BRAF mutants, would be expected to co-occur with activating RAS mutation or NF1 inactivation, whereas in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancers, this mutation would most likely be associated with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) hyperactivation at the protein level (PMID: 28783719). Preclinical studies with colorectal cancer cells expressing BRAF G596R demonstrated sensitivity to treatment with PLX8394, RMC-4550 and trametinib plus dabrafenib as measured by inhibition of cellular proliferation, and resistance to treatment with vemurafenib as measured by persistent ERK and MEK activation (PMID: 30559419, 30104724,  28947956, 28783719).

Subsequently, the patient progressed on sorafenib and in the post-progression specimen, the D842V mutation had replaced T674I. Experiments in cell lines transformed with the PDGFRA fusion confirmed that the T674I mutation confers resistance to imatinib but not sorafenib, whereas D842V mediated resistance to both inhibitors as measured by cellular growth and sustained pathway activation (PMID: 19212337).",

Biological characterization of specific ROS1 fusion proteins demonstrates that they are activating as shown by enhanced proliferation and colony formation and that they are sensitive to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors crizotinib and entrectinib (PMID: 23719267, 22919003, 22215748, 28465216).

Structural studies demonstrate that the TP53 R337P mutation is unable to form TP53 tetramers, and tetramerization is required for TP53 DNA binding activity (PMID: 20978130)."

In vitro studies with various human cancer cell lines expressing TP53 C275F also demonstrated the mutation is inactivating as measured by reduced growth suppression activity as compared to wildtype (PMID: 29979965, 30224644).",

In vitro studies with various human cancer cell lines expressing TP53 S215I also demonstrated the mutation is inactivating as measured by reduced growth suppression activity as compared to wildtype (PMID: 29979965, 30224644).",

In vitro studies with H1299 cells expressing TP53 G360V demonstrate that the mutation is likely neutral as measured by colony growth comparable to wildtype (PMID: 33257846). Other in vitro studies with various human cancer cell lines expressing TP53 G360V also demonstrate that the mutation is likely neutral as measured by growth suppression activity comparable to wildtype (PMID: 29979965, 30224644). In vivo studies with yeast expressing TP53 G360V demonstrate that the mutation is likely neutral as measured by transactivational activity comparable to wildtype (PMID: 27328919, 12826609). In contrast, in vitro studies with H1299 cells expressing TP53 G360V demonstrate that the mutation is activating as measured by increased transactivational activity, increased apoptosis and decreased colony growth compared to wildtype (PMID: 27297285).",
